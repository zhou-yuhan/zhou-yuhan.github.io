I am an undergraduate in School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in Peking University. 

I am about to persue my Ph.D. in [SOAR](https://soar.group/) group and advised by Prof. [Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/). My research interests are wireless networks and mobile systems, especially next generation network access technology.
